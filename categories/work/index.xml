      <description>&lt;p&gt;A month has already gone since my start at &lt;a href=&#34;https://aiven.io/&#34;&gt;Aiven.io&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s time for a first, and brief, look back at my experience so far together with few suggestions (even if nobody asks) for anyone that will follow my steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: The journey has been great, met several amazing people and learnt lots using cool tech! A bit shocked about food choices&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s life 🤌 !&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now&amp;hellip; What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftisiot.net//2020/11/26/looking_back/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; was looking back in my 8 years of Rittman Mead experience&amp;hellip; But now it&amp;rsquo;s 2021&amp;hellip; so&amp;hellip; what&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m joining &lt;a href=&#34;https://aiven.io&#34;&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; as Developer Advocate!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It was February 2012 when I was meant to take a flight from a foggy Treviso Airport direction London Stansted. The fog created several problems, all passengers were taken by bus to Venice and we had to wait 3 hours before boarding on the plane. The flight 🛬 landed with an overall 4h of delay, not great if the scheduled arrival time was 8PM! I then caught a bus to Liverpool street and finally got lost while trying to reach my hotel.</description>
