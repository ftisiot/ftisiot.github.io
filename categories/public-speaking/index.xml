The part briefly mentioned was about talks ageing pretty quickly these days with online-only conferences and I thought it needed more clarification.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a great year, with Covid forcing people home and all major events moving from physical to virtual. At the same time, now is the perfect time for attendees: everyone is creating and sharing content via videos, blogs or talks in conferences. People that before had to choose wisely the &amp;ldquo;1 conference&amp;rdquo; where to spend their budget on, now can access for free (or reduced fees) content coming from a huge variety of organisations and speakers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
