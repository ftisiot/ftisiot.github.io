    <meta name="description" content="PostgreSQL may not be the first thing that comes to mind when we think about AI, but it&#39;s becoming increasingly important for a growing number of users. In this talk, we&#39;ll take a look at the current state of AI and explain why PostgreSQL has a potential to play a key role in it.
We&#39;ll start by exploring workflows and architectures, from the traditional Machine Learning approach of training and forecasting to the modern Generative AI techniques of fine-tuning and prompt engineering. In this step, we&#39;ll show how PostgreSQL can serve as a data source.
Moving forward, you’ll see how feeding the AI pipeline back to PostgreSQL can lead to accurate and consistent inference. Finally we&#39;ll look into how AI can help PostgreSQL users improve performance pattern discovery, optimize indexing, and suggest query optimizations.
As AI continues to become a bigger part of every company, this session will help you to make sure PostgreSQL and your implementations remain relevant on this journey.">
